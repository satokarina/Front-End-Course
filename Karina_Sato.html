         <h2>Hi!</h2>
         <p>My name is Karina and I come from the marvelous city of Rio de Janeiro
            I graduated in Industrial Engineering and have Master in Investment Management. I've been working with finance ever since. 
            Now living in the Bay Area, I'm starting a new chapter of my life at UC Berkeley and pivoting my career toward UX Design.
            While being in this innovative environment, I can also enjoy the nature that surrounds me when hiking on the coast and surfing in the cold water of California.
